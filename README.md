## Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Monitoring Program

This project focuses on developing an advanced image processing-based program to monitor the efficacy of treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The program includes:

- **Preprocessing**: Enhancing brain MRI images through noise reduction, normalization, filtering and resampling.
- **Segmentation**: Manually segment brain regions such as hippocampus and cortex for precise segmentation.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Generating three-dimensional models of brain structures from segmented images.
- **Volume Calculation**: Computing and comparing the volumes of segmented regions to assess disease progression and treatment efficacy.

The program aims to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and efficient method for clinicians to monitor and optimize treatment strategies for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease.
